[mod-setting-description]
FunkedOre-transform-string=The ore transforms to apply. See the mod page for an explanation of how this works.
FunkedOre-min-distance-from-spawn=Set to 0 to disable. If this is set to say 50, then the substitutions will only be applied to resource tiles that are 50 or more tiles away from where you first spawned.
FunkedOre-control-point-reach-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. This setting controls how far away an ore tile's chosen mixture applies to other ore tiles. See mod page for details.
FunkedOre-control-point-early-stop-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. See mod page for details. This setting is used to slightly speed up ore substitution by stopping early when looking for the mixture chosen closest to a given ore tile. You can set this to zero to disable the optimization.
FunkedOre-control-point-reproduce-after-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. See mod page for details. If you set this to a number greater than the reach distance, that will stop ore mixture choices in one place from influencing ore mixture choices far away, even when the two places are joined by frequent ore patches.
