FunkedOre-transform-string=The ore transforms to apply. See the mod page for an explanation of how this works.
FunkedOre-control-point-reach-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. This setting controls how far away an ore tile's chosen mixture applies to other ore tiles. See mod page for details.
FunkedOre-control-point-early-stop-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. See mod page for details. This setting is used to slightly speed up ore substitution by stopping early when looking for the mixture chosen closest to a given ore tile. You can set this to zero to disable the optimization.
FunkedOre-control-point-reproduce-after-dist=You should only need to adjust this if you're using a mod that changes the distribution patterns of ores dramatically. See mod page for details. If you set this to a number greater than the reach distance, that will stop ore mixture choices in one place from influencing ore mixture choices far away, even when the two places are joined by frequent ore patches.
